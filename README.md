GIS CSV Data Parser

This project reads a GIS dataset in the form of a CSV file, processes the data per challenge requirements, and based off of user preference, gives off partial or full reports.

The types of reports you can have are:
  1. Total number of points in the dataset
  2. Count of points by type
  3. Point requiring maintenance (Condition rating < 3)
  4. Points not inspected in the last year (2024)
  5. Geographical bounds of the dataset (min/max Latitude and Longitude)
  6. First and last install dates
  7. Full report

No external libraries are needed.

How to run:
  Download and unzip code
  CD to path
  Make sure that the csv file is in the project folder
  Run "csvparser.py"
  Output will be placed in "ExpectedOutput.txt"
